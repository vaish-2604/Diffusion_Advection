#INK DROPLET DIFFUSION AND ADVECTION
#Setup: Consider a laminar flow field with u = sin � cos �, v = −cos � sin �, in the domain
[0,2�]! with periodic boundary condition. Now we add an ink drop in this domain at a given
point. The concentration �(�, �) of the ink is following advection diffusion equation:
�"� + (�. �)� = �∇!�
The bold face symbols represent vector, otherwise all the symbols represent a scalar field.
� = (u, v) is the fluid velocity vector and � is diffusivity of the concentration field. Consider
the initial concentration of the ink-droplet to be �(�, �) = exp[−((� − �#)! +
(� − �#)!)/2�!].
